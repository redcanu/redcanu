    (Red Canu, click for testimonials)</a>
  <br>The biggest advantage of staying in a condo is the economies of scale.
  However, many condos are not able to realize this due to the lack of understanding by many managers.
  Many condos lack economies of scale by paying over $300 per month per unit.
  <br>Setting of new KPIs for condos and commercial properties so that a clear understanding
  of the total cashflow is indexed against past utilizations.
  <br>...accounting<br>...finance<br>...bookeeping<br>Much more is done than analyzing a
  balance sheet.  Portfolio under management $500 million</p>

  Since Red Canu had been the managing agent of Urban Loft condo for close to 4 years,
  progressive improvements had been achieved to date:
  <br>-managed and executed site facelift safely enabling property appreciation.
  <br>-continual growth of healthy financial reserve enabling reduction in monthly
  maintenance fee for all unit owners.
  <br>-utilizing energy saving lights to reduce significant power consumption resulting
  in lower utilities bill.

  Red Canu has been the managing agent for Coronation Arcade for the past 5 years.
 During this period, a number of significant improvements were made, one of which was the roof
 leakages.  It was rectified after careful professional surveys and at a very reasonable cost.
 Another was the outdated fire alarm system.  A new system was purchased and installed without
 a dent to the MCST funds.  Red Canu has provided value to all residents here.</p>

 Mr Leong was asked to take over the management of our condo (around owen road) after we had
 a bad experience with our previous management company. <br> I am very satisfied with his
 management ever since.  His response is always prompt, and problems solved in a timely manner.
The maintenance and expense control have also been very satisfactory.  I would recommend
Mr Leong to anyone looking for a responsible management company for their property.</p>

  Mr Leong and his team (team based in Thomson Road) has been very helpful in finding the
  leaking issues that caused damages to our study room wall.  They tirelessly eliminated one
  possibility after another to finally getting to the root problem, which was actually caused
  by the hairline crack on the outside wall of our condos common area.</p>
  <p style="text-align: left">In gist, they are very professional and responsive in handling our
  issues, and we truly appreciate their service.  Thank you</p>
